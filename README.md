# My Kaggle Data Science and Machine Learning Notebooks

Here, you can find some of my data science notebooks, based on Kaggle data.
Every notebook comes with a Dockerfile, so you easiliy run the notebooks inside Docker on your own machine.
The following links take you directly to the notebooks.

- [Santander Challenge.](Santander/Santander.ipynb) \
Use gradient boosting to predict whether a customer of the bank will make a specific transaction in the future.

- [Pneumonia Detection using Chest X-Rays.](Xray/todo.ipynb) \
Use convolutional neural networks on X-rays of a patient's chest to decide whether they have pneumonia.

- [MNIST Digit Recognition.](MNIST-DigitRecognition/todo.ipynb) \
The classic handwritten digit recognition challenge based on the MNIST dataset.
